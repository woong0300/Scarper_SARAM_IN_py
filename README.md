# Scraper_SARAM_IN_py
Scraping SARAM IN(Korean Recruitment Website) with Python

You can give the input word to search at the SARAM IN site, and this will give you csv file, 

which arranged with recruit title, company name, corp location, job detail and application link

If I have some chances to make this as a web app or service, I would do it. 

so, please look to next step of this project!

Thanks!!
